we need to combine loader and browse into a single directory, a single project. we should structure the code better, so that there's the syncer, which does loading and embedding, and then the servre, which is the live site. it should use the same logic and code etc and just be in one directory. also, lets make it so that the table name is related to the bucket name, so we can have multiple deployments in the same databasea but with different front ends. think through what you need and then ask me questions one at a time.
