## Project Notes

**Image Browser Project - Dimension Storage Implementation**

Files modified:
- src/shared/db.ts: Added width/height columns to schema, migration logic in ensureSchema()
- src/syncer/upload.ts: Captures dimensions using image-size during upload
- src/server/server.ts: Returns dimensions in queries, outputs to HTML
- src/syncer/backfill-dimensions.ts: NEW - Migration tool for existing images
- package.json: Added image-size@1.1.1, backfill-dimensions script
- mise.toml: Added backfill-dimensions task

The backfill script successfully processed all 300 images, adding 300x300 dimensions to each row.

Testing verified: HTML now includes width="300" height="300" on all img tags when fetched from http://localhost:3001/

**Important**: image-size 2.x has breaking changes - stick with 1.1.1 for stability.
