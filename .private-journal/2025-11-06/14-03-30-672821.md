## Project Notes

Image browser NSFW gate feature completed:

Files modified:
- .env: Added NSFW_GATE=false (default off)
- src/server.ts:26: Read env var as boolean
- src/server.ts:158: Pass to template via replacement
- src/server/template.html: Added overlay styles (lines 43-49), HTML (81-90), and JS logic (181-212)

Feature behavior:
- When NSFW_GATE=true, shows full-screen overlay on first visit
- Message: "These are unfiltered images from the internet. Children discouraged from viewing."
- "I Understand" button saves acknowledgment to localStorage
- ESC key closes without saving (will reappear on refresh)
- Once acknowledged, never shows again for that browser

To enable: Change NSFW_GATE=false to NSFW_GATE=true in .env and restart server
