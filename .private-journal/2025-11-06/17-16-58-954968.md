## Project Notes

Added data source attribution feature to image browser:
- Added two env variables: DATA_SOURCE_TEXT and DATA_SOURCE_URL for configurable attribution
- Created attribution widget in top-right corner using Inconsolata monospace font from Google Fonts
- Widget is conditionally rendered only when both env vars are set (graceful degradation)
- Positioned in fixed container alongside stats widget using flexbox column layout
- Uses semi-transparent white background with backdrop blur for modern look
- Attribution appears above stats circle, both right-aligned

Key implementation details:
- Template uses {{ATTRIBUTION_WIDGET}} placeholder that gets replaced in server.ts
- Server builds HTML string conditionally based on env var presence
- escapeHtmlAttribute() used for XSS protection
- Widget styling matches existing stats widget aesthetic (rounded corners, shadow, hover states)
