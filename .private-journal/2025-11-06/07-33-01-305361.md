## Project Notes

Refactoring complete - ready for testing.

Next steps for user:
1. pnpm install
2. Copy .env from loader or browse to root
3. Ensure R2_BUCKET is set (no R2_PREFIX needed)
4. Run pnpm run ensure-schema to create bucket-named table
5. Test syncer: pnpm run upload, pnpm run embed
6. Test server: pnpm run server:dev
7. Manually migrate existing data if needed

Old directories (loader/, browse/) can be deleted after testing confirms everything works.

All imports changed from relative ./file.js to ../shared/file.js
CLI args preserved (tsx src/shared/db.ts ensure-schema still works)
